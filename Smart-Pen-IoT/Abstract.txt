Abstract—
The Internet of Things (IoT) has reshaped vital sectors like education and productivity by enabling real-time data collecting and analysis. 
This project describes a smart pen meant to detect attention drifts and concentration lapses during writing jobs, which uses IoT technologies to improve real-time focus detection.
The smart pen is fitted with a variety of sensors, including an accelerometer, gyroscope, and pressure sensor, which monitor the user's writing behaviors and style while delivering statistics on concentration levels.
This data is evaluated using sophisticated algorithms to detect instances of cognitive stray.
The smart pen contains a companion app called the Blynk app that employs wireless connectivity to perform graphical analysis of writing patterns, alerting users when inattentive and providing real-time feedback to help them restore focus. 
Initially, the smart pen can effectively help users regain lost concentration, resulting in increased productivity and discipline in learning contexts.
This cognitive alert pen improves concentration, creativity, and productivity in educational environments. 
Such an attention drift detection tool not only gives rapid feedback, but it also evaluates performance, promoting a more disciplined and focused learning environment.

Keywords— IoT, sensors, focus detection, alert pen, graphical analysis, attention drift, Blynk app.
